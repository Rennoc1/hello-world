# hello-world
Im new
I just discovered GitHub after hearing about it for sometime. I'm fairly new to the whole programming thing so please try to be nice.
I learn fast and want to help, let me know if you need anything. I shall try and familiarize myself with different languages.
So for the time being give me tips and tricks and we'll see what happens.
